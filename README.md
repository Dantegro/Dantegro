- Open to collaborating on focused, execution-driven SaaS tools with other solo devs.
- Interested in: growth tactics for solo products, distribution strategies, niche validation.
- Ask me about: web app architecture, TypeScript, backend APIs, solo indie hacking, workflow automation.
- Reach me: [dan@dantegro.com](mailto:dan@dantegro.com) or dantegro.com
- I prefer shipping over celebrating. No BS, just execution.
